In particular, one can propagate back the loss information to also change the procedure with which the very same papers are embedded. This idea relies on the simple yet possibly very powerful intuition that embeddings produced by SPECTER might suffer from over-generalization (*i.e.*, they might be not so specific for the tackled task) when used in the context of Text Classification.\n",

To this aim, Text Classification simply is a downstream activity and in this does not enter the pipeline in its initial stages. Indeed, it is no more relevant to the procedure with which to embed paper than other tasks such as Citation Prediciton, for instance. \n",
