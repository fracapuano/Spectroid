    "abstract": "Numerous studies of E-Commerce have emphasized the sway of obstacles related to Information Technology (IT) infrastructure, Socio economic condition, Internet usage, Government and regulatory initiatives as major determinants of ecommerce success. Information communication technology (ICT) revolutionizes businesses around the world. In this paper e-commerce practices in Malaysia has been analyzed by its strength, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. This paper provides a general review of challenges and opportunities for e commerce practices in Malaysia. And to understand the in-depth of e-commerce practices and to investigates more solutions for the research problems. Analysis shows that E-Commerce in Malaysia is moving towards uptrend direction. But still there are some challenges which are influencing on E-Commerce. The challenges such as economic condition of the country, low wages of labors, low internet access, lack of awareness of online purchasing, e-readiness, high cost and legacy of fast internet. Findings show that there are sweet opportunities which can boost up E-Commerce in Malaysia. Strategic position of the country, political stability, foreign investment in information and communication technology (ICT) and high rate of education can be the charming part of E-Commerce growth in Malaysia.",

    "title": "Interactions between model membranes and lignin-related compounds studied by immobilized liposome chromatography.",
    "abstract": "In order to elucidate the modes of interaction between lignin precursors and membranes, we have studied the influence of temperature, lipid composition and buffer composition on the partitioning of monolignol and dilignol model substances into phospholipid bilayers. The partitioning was determined by immobilized liposome chromatography, which is an established method for studies of pharmaceutical drugs but a new approach in studies of lignin synthesis. The temperature dependence of the retention and the effect of a high ammonium sulfate concentration in the mobile phase demonstrated that the interaction involved both hydrophobic effects and polar interactions. There was also a good correlation between the partitioning and the estimated hydrophobicity, in terms of octanol/water partitioning. The partitioning behavior of the model substances suggests that passive diffusion over the cell membrane is a possible transport route for lignin precursors. This conclusion is strengthened by comparison of the present results with the partitioning of pharmaceutical drugs that are known to pass cell membranes by diffusion.",

    "abstract": "This paper studies a public firm's investment decision and whether to raise the equity capital needed using the public market (SEO, Secondary Equity Offering) or a private channel (PIPE, Private Investment in Public Equity). Issuing a PIPE allows the firm to enjoy more financial flexibility. This is modeled in two dimensions: First, funds can be raised faster. Second, dilution costs caused by asymmetric information can be alleviated endogenously. However PIPEs are costly because new shares are temporarily illiquid. The model explains what firms use one market or the other and the optimal timing of investments to better use financial flexibility. For instance, market illiquidity makes the firm less likely to issue a PIPE, asymmetric information makes it more likely. The paper then considers private debt contracts and shows that the pecking order need not hold. The model explains empirical regularities, for instance, why do SEOs have negative abnormal returns around its announcement whereas abnormal returns for PIPEs are positive.",

There was no scientific research so far about these changes. Based on a cross-sectional study in 2001, there are 39,122 registered and professionally active members in the Hungarian Medical Chamber in Hungary. There are 33,915 physicians and 5,207 dentists. At present, the total number of foreign citizens among them amounts to 797, including 517 doctors who studied in Hungarian universities, albeit in English, not in Hungarian. There are also 2,167 doctors with Hungarian citizenship with a medical diploma from abroad. It is likely, that 260-270 people in this group were already Hungarian citizens before entering medical training. Subtracting them from the 2,167 doctors and adding 517 foreigners trained in Hungary, it may be stated that approximately 2,400 doctors work in the Hungarian health care as a result of international migration.",

    "abstract": "We present the first class of mathematically rigorous, general, fully self-referential, self-improving, optimally efficient problem solvers. Inspired by Kurt Goedel's celebrated self-referential formulas (1931), such a problem solver rewrites any part of its own code as soon as it has found a proof that the rewrite is useful, where the problem-dependent utility function and the hardware and the entire initial code are described by axioms encoded in an initial proof searcher which is also part of the initial code. The searcher systematically and efficiently tests computable proof techniques (programs whose outputs are proofs) until it finds a provably useful, computable self-rewrite. We show that such a self-rewrite is globally optimal - no local maxima! - since the code first had to prove that it is not useful to continue the proof search for alternative self-rewrites. Unlike previous non-self-referential methods based on hardwired proof searchers, ours not only boasts an optimal order of complexity but can optimally reduce any slowdowns hidden by the O()-notation, provided the utility of such speed-ups is provable at all.",

It uses conditional rewrite rules to define the dynamic semantics and other tool-oriented aspects of languages, so the effectiveness of the generated tools is critically dependent on the quality of the rewrite rule implementation. The ASF+SDF rewrite rule compiler generates C code, thus taking advantage of C's portability and the sophisticated optimization capabilities of current C compilers as well as avoiding potential abstract machine interface bottlenecks. It can handle large (10,000+ rule) language definitions and uses an efficient run-time storage scheme capable of handling large (1,000,000+ node) terms. Term storage uses maximal subterm sharing (hash-consing), which turns out to be more effective in the case of ASF+SDF than in Lisp or SML. Extensive benchmarking has shown the time and space performance of the generated code to be as good as or better than that of the best current rewrite rule and functional language compilers.",

    "abstract": "Across the social sciences, a recurring theme is that market production, where goods and services are produced for monetized exchange by capitalist firms for profit-motivated purposes, has replaced non-market production in the advanced economies. The aim of this paper is to evaluate critically this marketization thesis. Analyzing data on the volume of market and non-market activity, this paper reveals not only the relatively shallow penetration of the market sphere but also how for some four decades, contrary to the marketization thesis, the non-market sphere has been growing relative to the market realm. Rather than view non-market activity as a vestige of a pre-capitalist past, this paper thus explains the persistence and growth of non-market activity as a product of both the prevalence of resistance cultures to marketism and the inherent contradictions embedded in the pursuit of marketization. The paper thus concludes that not only is there a need to decentre representations of the market as victorious, pervasive and hegemonic, but also for greater recognition and value to be given to the non-market realm and the possibility of alternative futures beyond marketization.",

We assessed the rate of receipt of these therapies among eligible ischemic stroke patients age \u226565 years and determined the effects of age and other patient characteristics on treatment.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nThe analysis included Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries discharged with ischemic stroke (ICD 433.x1, 434.x1, 436) randomly selected for inclusion in the Medicare Health Care Quality Improvement Program's National Stroke Project 1998 to 1999, 2000 to 2001. Patients discharged from nonacute facilities, transferred, or terminally ill were excluded. Receipt of in-hospital pharmacological deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, antiplatelet medication, anticoagulants for atrial fibrillation, and antithrombotic medications at discharge were assessed in eligible patients, stratified by age (65 to 74, 75 to 84, and 85+ years). Descriptive models identified characteristics associated with treatment. Among 31 554 patients, 14.9% of those eligible received pharmacological deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, 83.9% antiplatelet drugs, 82.8% anticoagulants for atrial fibrillation, and 74.2% were discharged on an antithrombotic medication. Rates of treatment decreased with age and were lowest for patients ages 85 years or older. Admission from a skilled nursing facility and functional dependence were associated with lower treatment rates.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThere was substantial underutilization of antithrombotic therapies among elderly ischemic stroke patients, particularly among the very elderly, those admitted from skilled nursing facilities, and patients with functional dependence. The reasons for low use of antithrombotic therapies, including the apparent underutilization of deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis in otherwise eligible patients, require further investigation.",

    "title": "An Efficient Algorithm for Learning Distances that Obey the Triangle Inequality",
    "abstract": "Semi-supervised clustering improves performance using constraints that indicate if two images belong to the same category or not. Success depends on how effectively these constraints can be propagated to the unsupervised data. Many algorithms use these constraints to learn Euclidean distances in a vector space. However, distances between images are often computed using classifiers or combinatorial algorithms that make distance learning difficult. In such a setting, we propose to use the triangle inequality to propagate constraints to unsupervised data. First, we formulate distance learning as a metric nearness problem where a brute-force Quadratic Program (QP) is used to modify the distances such that the total change in distances is minimized but the final distances obey the triangle inequality. Then we propose a much faster version of the QP that enforces only a subset of the inequalities and can be applied to real world clustering datasets. We show experimentally that this efficient QP produces stronger clustering results on face, leaf and video image datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods for constrained clustering. To gain insight into the effectiveness of this algorithm, we analyze a special case of the semi-supervised clustering problem, and show that the subset of constraints that we sample still preserves key properties of the distances that would be produced by enforcing all constraints.",

    "abstract": "food substrates has evolved from interactions with the trillions of microorganisms that co-exist in our gut. But what evolutionary factors shape the diversity of gut microbial communities? Reporting in Science, Ley, Gordon and colleagues now provide us with a microbial view of mammalian evolution with their finding that mammalian diet, phylogeny and gut physiology influence the composition of the gut microbiota and that microbial communities have co-diversified with their hosts. Gordon et al. conducted a census of the faecal bacterial communities of 59 different mammalian species living in zoos in San Diego and St Louis, USA, and in the wild, including 17 non-human primates and animals that had an unusual diet for their taxonomic lineage. New network-based analyses together with more traditional tree-based analyses were then used to relate gut community ecology to the mammalian hosts that harbour them. In general, the gut microbial composition of members of a single mammalian species was similar regardless of its provenance, supporting the notion of inter-generational transfer of gut communities. The ability to use plants as a food source evolved repeatedly from ancestral carnivorous mammals. Moreover, most extant mammals are herbivores. Based on 16S ribosomal RNA, the gut microbiota of herbivores in this study was found to be more diverse than that of omnivores and carnivores, which suggests that diet is an important determinant of microbial community structure. The authors\u2019 work indicates that promiscuous gut microorganisms allowed unrelated mammals with similar gut structures to assemble similar microbial communities and that the microbial solution to herbivory in different gut structures (for example, a simple gut, a hindgut or a foregut) was similar regardless of host lineage. Humans seem to be representative of typical omnivores and can be placed together with our omnivorous primate relatives. This bottom-up perspective of animal evolution implicates gut microorganisms as co-conspirators in the spectacular evolutionary success of mammals. According to Gordon and colleagues, \u2018\u2018our next task is to characterize the microbial communities\u2019 gene content (microbiomes) to better understand how these observations relate to the metabolic capacities of the microbiota and expand these studies to other members of the animal kingdom.\u2019\u2019 Gillian Young",

    "abstract": "This paper provides an empirical analysis of the financial structure of large recent buyouts. We collect detailed information of the financings of 153 large buyouts (averaging over $1 billion in enterprise value). We document the manner in which these important transactions are financed. Buyout leverage is cross-sectionally unrelated to the leverage of matched public firms, and is largely driven by other factors than what explains leverage in public firms. In particular, the economy-wide cost of borrowing seems to drive leverage. Prices paid in buyouts are related to the prices observed for matched firms in the public market, but are also strongly affected by the economy-wide cost of borrowing. These results are consistent with a view in which the availability of financing impacts booms and busts in the private equity market.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic dataflow models for their expressiveness properties have shown to represent more adequate and attractive solutions for describing state of the art signal processing applications. However, they are known to present potential run-time penalties when implementations are obtained by mapping and scheduling a dataflow network partition on a processing unit. In general terms, a completely static scheduling at compile-time of dynamic dataflow programs remains an unsolved problem. Several approaches for the composition of actors are promising approach that can significantly reduce the potential penalty of run-time scheduling thus increasing the overall performance of the system. This paper presents static and quasi-static composition techniques that results in a reduction of the portion of dynamic dataflow networks, by applying appropriate transformations to network partitions that after a specific analysis demonstrate to possess a predictable behaviour. Some experiments based on a video processing application ported on several system-on-chips show the achievable speedup corresponding to the reduction of the number of run-time scheduling decisions.",

    "abstract": "Social enterprise as a concept is at the core of the United Kingdom\u2019s government strategies of ameliorating socio economic deprivation and has experienced phenomenal growth across the country over the years. Globalisation and increased demands for effective social welfare interventions is increasingly forcing social enterprises to evaluate their governance structures in addition to business models to ensure success and longevity of their operations. Consequently, there has been an upsurge of interest in the governance of social enterprises over the past 15 years as it has become apparent that financial sustainability of social enterprise also depends on effective decision making at strategic level and their ability to engage with a variety of stakeholders outside the social economy. Despite this increased in interest there are still significant gaps in the understanding and knowledge of how nature and type of governance model influence the operational efficiency of social enterprises. This is particularly in view of apparent shift from democratic to stewardship types of governance models of governance by some social enterprise. The focus of this paper is on generating additional knowledge on the reasons of this paradigm shift in social enterprise governance, given lack of in-depth academic scrutiny on this phenomenon. The paper presents and critically analyses key results emerging from a doctoral investigation on the governance of social enterprise in South Yorkshire.",

However, in their existing form, GANs have no means of learning the inverse mapping -- projecting data back into the latent space. We propose Bidirectional Generative Adversarial Networks (BiGANs) as a means of learning this inverse mapping, and demonstrate that the resulting learned feature representation is useful for auxiliary supervised discrimination tasks, competitive with contemporary approaches to unsupervised and self-supervised feature learning.",

The magnetic poly(vinyl alcohol-co-ethylene) (PVA-co-PE)/Fe3O4 composite nanofibers were prepared via the melt extrusion of cellulose acetate butyrate matrix and PVA-co-PE preloaded with different amounts of Fe3O4 nanoparticles. The morphologies of magnetic composite nanofibers were characterized by scanning electron microscopy. The uniform dispersion of Fe3O4 nanoparticles in nanofiber matrixes and crystal structures were confirmed using transmission electron microscopy and wide angle X-ray diffraction. Thermogravimetric analysis was employed to quantify the exact loading amount of Fe3O4 nanoparticles in the composite nanofibers. The magnetic measurements showed that composite nanofibers displayed superparamagnetic behavior at room temperature. With increasing content of Fe3O4 nanoparticles, the saturation magnetization of the magnetic composite nanofiber significantly improved. The prepared magnetic composite nanofibers might have found potential applications in the sensors and bio-molecular separation fields. Copyright \u00a9 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryogenesis - the emergence of eukaryotic cells - represents a pivotal evolutionary event. With a fundamentally more complex cellular plan compared to prokaryotes, eukaryotes are major contributors to most aspects of life on Earth. For decades, we have understood that eukaryotic origins lie within both the Archaea domain and \u03b1-Proteobacteria. However, it is much less clear when, and from which precise ancestors, eukaryotes originated, or the order of emergence of distinctive eukaryotic cellular features. Many competing models for eukaryogenesis have been proposed, but until recently, the absence of discriminatory data meant that a consensus was elusive. Recent advances in paleogeology, phylogenetics, cell biology and microbial diversity, particularly the discovery of the 'Candidatus Lokiarcheaota' phylum, are now providing new insights into these aspects of eukaryogenesis. The new data have allowed the time frame during which eukaryogenesis occurred to be finessed, a more precise identification of the contributing lineages and the biological features of the contributors to be clarified. Considerable advances have now been used to pinpoint the prokaryotic origins of key eukaryotic cellular processes, such as intracellular compartmentalisation, with major implications for models of eukaryogenesis.",

In adults with cancer, TE results in poor outcome. We evaluated the impact of CVL-dysfunction and TE on overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) in children with noncentral nervous system cancer (n=358). CVL-dysfunction was defined as persistent or recurrent difficulty of blood draw and/or infusion. Event was defined as cancer relapse, second malignancy, or death due to any cause. OS and EFS were estimated using Kaplan-Meier method and survival curves compared using log-rank test. Hazard ratios (HR) were calculated using the Weibull regression model. Diagnosis of TE (n=43, 12%) had no effect on the OS and EFS. Children with CVL-dysfunction (n=74, 21%) had shorter 5- and 10-year EFS compared with children without CVL-dysfunction (P=0.029 and P=0.027). Multiple regression analyses, adjusting for age, sex, diagnostic era, TE, and cancer type identified CVL-dysfunction as an independent determinant of 5-year OS (HR 1.87; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-3.42; P=0.043) and EFS (HR 1.96; 95% confidence interval, 1.23-3.41; P=0.018). Although the etiology of adverse impact of CVL-dysfunction on survival is unknown, its prevention and prompt treatment may improve outcome from cancer in children. Further prospective studies are recommended.",

While North Korea began to experiment with reforms and a partial open-door policy in the mid-1980s, the most substantial attempt at economic restructuring occurred in July 2002. In these latest reforms, the government attempted to change the planned economic system through the introduction of price reforms, market and commodity relations, profit motivation and material incentives. However, scholars disagree on the nature and direction of economic restructuring. In order to analyze the state of economic transformation, we develop a conceptual framework of market socialism with a set of empirical indicators against which we examine the trends, direction and limitations of reforms. Our study strongly suggests that North Korea is moving away from the command economy towards a model of market socialism as practiced in China and Vietnam.",

A focal zone beneath Shiveluch is dipping at an angle of 70\u00b0 at depths of 100\u2013200 km. Based on the revealed interrelations between seismicity at depths of 105\u2013120 km and an extrusive phase of its eruptions in 1980 through 1994, it is inferred that primary magmas, periodically feeding the crustal chamber, are melted at depths of at least 100 km. An upsurge of extrusive-explosive activity at the volcano is preceded and accompanied by the increasing number and energy of both volcanic earthquakes beneath the dome and tectonic or volcano-tectonic earthquakes in the zones of NW-striking crustal faults near the volcano.The eruption of April 1993 has been the most powerful since 1964. It was successfully predicted based on interactive use of all seismic data. At the same time the influence of seismicity at depths of 105\u2013120 km under the volcano on the style (and consequently on prediction) of its activity is decisive.",

    "title": "The CALCULEMUS research training network: A short overview",
    "abstract": "Calculemus research aims at the integration of systems for symbolic computation and symbolic reasoning and is related to the QPQ initiative. It is in the spirit of both projects to discuss these connections and potential collaborations. The following text sketches the structure and scientific contributions of the Calculemus Research Training Network (Calculemus RTN; see Figure 1 for the partner sites) since its start in September 2000. It has been reproduced from the networks midterm report [22] and credit is due to all researchers of the Calculemus RTN. More than 28 young visiting researchers (with a sum approx. 150 financed person-months) have been supported by the network so far and approx. 47 senior researchers are involved in the training measures at the different partner sites.",

    "title": "New types of intuitionistic fuzzy interior ideals of ordered semigroups",
    "abstract": "In many applied disciplines like computer science, coding theory and formal languages, the use of fuzzified algebraic structures play a remarkable role. In this paper, we introduced some new types of generalization of an intuitionistic fuzzy interior ideal, called (a, s)-intuitionistic interior ideals of an ordered semigroup S. The important milestone of this paper is to link the ordinary interior ideals and (?, ? ?qk)-intuitionistic fuzzy interior ideals. The notion of (?, ? ? qk )-intuitionistic fuzzy interior ideal is introduced and characterizations of ordered semigroups in terms of (?, ? ?qk)-intuitionistic fuzzy interior ideals and (?, ? ? qk )-intuitionistic fuzzy interior ideals are given.",
